**Little Lemon Website üçã**
Welcome to the Little Lemon Website project, my capstone for Meta's Frontend Developer Professional Certificate! This site showcases a fully responsive web application for a Mediterranean restaurant. Key features include reservation booking, smooth navigation, and a visually appealing menu section. The project integrates modern frontend technologies like React, with attention to UI/UX design, and API functionality.

Feel free to explore the code and see how it's built!
